Interpreter:
* Translates program one statement at a time.	
* Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers.
* No Object Code is generated, hence are memory efficient.	
* Programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby use interpreters.	

Compilers:
* Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.
* Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.
* Generates Object Code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory.
* Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.

Program Day 1:

class Student{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
		int roll;
		String name;
		float marks;
		roll=scan.nextInt();
		name=scan.next();
		marks=scan.nextFloat();
		System.out.println(roll);
		System.out.println(name);
		System.out.println(marks);
	}
